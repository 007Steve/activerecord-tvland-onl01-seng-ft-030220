# TV Land ActiveRecord Associations Lab

## Objectives
1. Creating and modifying tables using ActiveRecord
2. Writing associations between models


## Instructions
1. Run rspec and read the tests. 
2. Give the Actor and Character model the attributes that the spec file requires.
3. Associate actors to characters. How can we build this assocation? Does an actor have many characters? How do we build an association like that?
4. Does actors need any other associations?
5. Define the model methods that the spec requires. Do you need any helper methods?
6. Write associations for the show model.
